# Referrals

Buffer's Referral Program allows anyone to generate a referral link and share it with potential traders trying to onboard on the Buffer Platform.
The program is meant to incentivize the community to leverage their network to increase the number of Buffer users. 
Additionally, it adds inclusivity to the platform since you donâ€™t have to be a pro-trader or a whale LP to benefit from being a part of the community. 

## Referee Benefits:
Upon using a valid referral code, referees receive a discount on their trade amount. This incentive motivates referees to engage in trades and encourages them to join the platform through the referrer's invitation.

## Referrer Benefits:
Referrers are rewarded with a rebate for each successful referral. This encourages existing users to invite new users to the platform, thereby expanding the user base.

## How does it work?

The referral program has a well-thought-out tier system to reward the most active members of the program:
- Tier 1: 1% per trade payout boost for traders, 0.25% payout boost to referees
- Tier 2: 2% per trade payout boost for traders, 0.50% payout boost to referees
- Tier 3: 3% per trade payout boost for traders, 0.75% payout boost to referees

**Anyone can create a Tier 1 code. To upgrade your code to Tier 2 or Tier 3:**

- Tier 2: At least 15 active users using your referral codes per week and a combined weekly volume above \$5 million
- Tier 3: At least 30 active users using your referral codes per week and a combined weekly volume above \$15 million

Once your account fulfills the criteria for tier 2 or tier 3, you can fill out the form here, to request an upgrade: Referral Program Upgrade Form. 
Once the form is filled and submitted, please also open a ticket on Discord to follow up on the tier upgrade.

Wallet providers and other protocols are eligible for Tier 2 and Tier 3 rewards as well.
