# Multiple Order Types

Currently Buffer offers two order types: market & limit orders. 

A market order tends to execute an up/down trade instantly at the current market price whereas a limit order is used to do the same at a specific target price.

Limit orders are largely utilized by traders who want to execute their trades at a desired price range without constantly having to monitor market volatility.

Payout Customizations for Limit Orders: 
Users can now secure their trade by selecting the minimum payout for limit orders.
Even if the dynamic payout fluctuates, your trade will only execute if it meets your set minimum.

To execute a limit order, the current price must fall within the slippage bounds of the trigger price, and the payout must exceed the user-specified minimum value.
