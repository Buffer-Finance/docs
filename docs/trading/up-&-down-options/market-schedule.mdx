# Market Schedule 
Market schedule of all live asset classes on the platform:

:::info
All timings in the table below are denominated in UTC

### Crypto

Crypto markets operate 24/7, allowing traders to enjoy an uninterrupted trading experience.

### Forex

Unlike crypto markets, forex markets follow a specific schedule. Refer to the table below to catch up with the Forex schedule.

We've made adjustments to our forex market operational hours to better align with the peak trading periods of major international markets. 
By focusing on these hours, we aim to offer our traders enhanced liquidity and potentially more significant market movements.

Refer to the table below to catch up with the Forex schedule:
