# Trading Parameters

We have put measures in place to mitigate the effects of any outliers 
and create a more stable payout structure that also promotes market diversification.  When trading options on Buffer, there are a number of key parameters to keep in mind. Specifically, these are:

## Trade Limiting Parameters:

### Max Trade Amount
The option size a user buys depends on the poolâ€™s available liquidity. Currently, the maximum liquidity utilization rate is capped at 40%. 
There is also a maximum utilization rate per asset per direction up/down, which is currently capped at 2% to 3% (depending on the asset pair).

### Max Trade Size
 In a single trade, a user can trade at most 0.25% of the poolâ€™s available liquidity. 
 In case the user tries trading for a greater amount of their partial fill is allowed, then the trade is opened for the max possible values; otherwise, the user is refunded.

## Pricing Parameters:

### Dynamic Fees
Buffer charges Trading Fees on the traders' position size. 
Buffer employs a "Dynamic Pricing" mechanism to incentivize or penalize traders, with the aim of maintaining balance in the Open Interest (OI) across various markets and promoting diversification among traders. 
Learn more about dynamic fees.


### Dynamic Spread
When you place simple Up/Down orders on, Buffer includes a spread in to the strike price. 
The price impact will be specific for each pair, and will also be different on each side (Up/Down). 
Hence, the opening price for an option slightly exceeds the current price for "Up" option and slightly undershoots it for "Down" options. 
On Buffer Spread is designed to trail higher when the markets are volatile. This parameter adds a position expectancy to the platform, thereby improving the possible outcome for LPs/ 

:::info
Spread is never applied when closing a trade
:::

#### Calculation:
Spread as a function of implied volatility (iv) proxied as historical volatility (hv) and open interest (oi) - scales
linearly from the lowest value i.e. 0.4 bp at 2.5% hv to 0.8 bp at 16% hv. 

Then this lowest value of spread increased linearly to 1.5 (spread factor) times the lowest value as utilization of that market increases. 

The formula is as follows:

$$
\text{spread} = (\text{m} \cdot \text{hv} + \text{c}) \cdot \left(1 + \text{spreadFactor} \cdot \frac{\text{totalMarketOI}}{\text{maxOI}}\right)
$$

Where:

- *m* is the rate change of spread with historical volatility 

$$
 m = \frac{{0.8 - 0.4}}{{0.16 - 0.025}} 
$$

- *c* is the base spread at minimum volatility

$$
 c = 0.4 - (m \cdot 0.025)
$$

- *h*v is the historical volatility

- *spreadFactor* is the factor by which the spread is adjusted based on market utilization.

- *totalMarketOI* is the total open interest in the market.

- *maxOI* is the maximum open interest allowed in the market.

It means the open price of all trades will still follow the strike price of the pair, but depending on the open interest on the pair it will be higher (Up) or lower (Down).

:::info
Buffer uses a historical volatility as a proxy for implied volatility. 
Historical Volatility calculated using garman-klass from the OHLC data obtained from Pyth. 
The hv values are continuously monitored for all the markets. 
These values are edited on-chain if the new values are 10% different from the values set in the contracts. 
:::

## Advanced Settings:

### Partial Fill
Partial fill is an advanced setting that opens a trade using the max possible value within the implemented max trade size limit. 
If the user tries to buy trade for more than what the pool allows then the contract will place a trade for the maximum possible value and refunds the rest of the fees back to the user.

### Slippage
On Buffer, slippage is used as the accepted price movement between when the user initiates the trade and when the trade is actually opened.
