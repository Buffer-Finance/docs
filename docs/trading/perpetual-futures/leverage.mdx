# Leverage & Margin

In the current version, leverage is calculated based on Maintenance Margin, which a safety parameter ensuring that there is always enough collateral in the account to cover potential losses. 

Maintenance Margin is defined as the minimum ratio of collateral to notional size that a specific market allows. 
It dictates. how much notional size leverage a trader (taker) can get. 

Formula: 

$$
\text{Maximum leverage} = \frac{1}{\text{maintenance\%}}
$$

Maintenance requirement is based on the notional of a trader's position times the margin percentage requirement. 

:::info
If the collateral amount entered by the trader falls below this margin requirement, the trader's position will be liquidated.
