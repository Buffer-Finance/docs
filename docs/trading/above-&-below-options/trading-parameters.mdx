# Trading Parameters

## Expiry & Trading Window:

- Trades can be accepted up to 12 hours before expiry.

Example:
If a contract expires on a Friday at 08:00 UTC, you can enter trades for that contract until 20:00 UTC on Thurday. 

- Trading for a new set of contracts opens 36 hours before the expiry of the most recent expiry. 

Example:
If a contract is set to expire at 08:00 UTC on December 26th, the trading for this contract would start at 20:00 UTC on December 24th. 

## Pricing Parameters:
### Skew:
Each market has an individual max exposure.

Calculation:

$$
\text{SKEW}(s) = \max(A \cdot B) - \left( \sum a + \sum b \right)
$$

Where,

- *A* is total Above trades
- *B* is total Below trades
- *u* is the premium on Above trades
- *b* is the premium on Below trades


The skew mechanims keeps the Buffer Liquidity pool balanced between Above & Below sides of the market, by applying a premium to the overbought side. 


### Dynamic Pricing:

- *S* is the max skew
- *s* is the current skew
- *B* is the base settlement fee (at 0 skew)
- *M* is the max settlement fee

#### If S is positive,

$$
\text{Sf}_{\text{Above}} = B + \left( \frac{M - B}{S} \right) \times s
$$



$$
\text{Sf}_{\text{Below}} = B - \left( \frac{B}{S} \right) \times s
$$


#### If S is negative,

$$
\text{Sf}_{\text{Above}} = B - \left( \frac{B}{S} \right) \times s
$$



$$
\text{Sf}_{\text{Below}} = B + \left( \frac{M - B}{S} \right) \times s
$$
