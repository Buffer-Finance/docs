# Trading Parameters

## Pricing Parameters:

### Contract Pricing

Buffer uses the Black-Scholes Algorithm to derive a realistic price for each above/below contract, using the following data points:

- Current Asset Price: price feeds are provided by the Pyth Oracle
- Distance to Strike Price: current distance to the strike price set at the time a trade is opened
- Distance to Strike Date: current distance to strike date set at the time a trade is opened
- Implied Volatility: Buffer proxies current implied volatility (iv) as historical volality (hv). hv of a contract is updated for each contract on a daily basis.


Skew:
Each market has an individual max exposure.

Calculation:

$$
\text{SKEW}(s) = \max(A \cdot B) - \left( \sum a + \sum b \right)
$$

Where,

- *A* is total Above trades
- *B* is total Below trades
- *u* is the premium on Above trades
- *b* is the premium on Below trades


### Dynamic Pricing:

- *S* is the max skew
- *s* is the current skew
- *B* is the base settlement fee (at 0 skew)
- *M* is the max settlement fee

#### If S is positive,

$$
\text{Sf}_{\text{Above}} = B + \left( \frac{M - B}{S} \right) \times s
$$



$$
\text{Sf}_{\text{Below}} = B - \left( \frac{B}{S} \right) \times s
$$


#### If S is negative,

$$
\text{Sf}_{\text{Above}} = B - \left( \frac{B}{S} \right) \times s
$$



$$
\text{Sf}_{\text{Below}} = B + \left( \frac{M - B}{S} \right) \times s
$$
