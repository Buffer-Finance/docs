# Fee

## Settlement Fee:

Settlement Fee (or trading fee) is the fee paid by takers (traders) to the makers (LPs). 
Buffer employs a "Dynamic Pricing" mechanism to incentivize or penalize takers, with the aim of maintaining balance in the directional Open Interest (OI)
across various markets and promoting diversification among takers. 

## Keeper Fee:

Placing Up/Down trades on Buffer incurs a flat fee for interactions with the Buffer keeper to compensate for the gas paid to the underlying blockchain while allowing for a 2x faster 1 Click trading experience. 
This is a fixed amount used to cover the keeper fee for opening & closing a trade. 

:::note
Due to the recent gas spikes on Arbitrum, we have implemented the platform fee model as dynamic. 
The fee is automatically adjusted every 24 hours based on the average cost incurred by the keepers.
